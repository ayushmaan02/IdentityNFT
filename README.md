# Identity NFT

## 🧾About 
This project consist of a smart contract `MyEpicNFT`, two scripts `run.js` and `deploy.js` for deploying the contracts in local for checking and over the test network through which people can acccess it. The contract is responsible for minting an on-chain svg bassed NFT which you can access through our react web application.

- Here we have used Polygon's Mumbai test network for deploying our contract.
- You can check your deployed contract over [Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/).
- To find your IdentityNFT [OpeanSea](https://testnets.opensea.io/). 

## 🔍 Find Identity NFT?
- After minting press `Ctrl+I` to open inspect window, copy the contract address.
- Go to [OpeanSea](https://testnets.opensea.io/)
- Just paste that Contract Address over OpeanSea **⚠ DON'T PRESS ENTER** wait for the IdentityNFT collection to popup.
- Click it and you will find your NFT.
